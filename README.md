âœ” I am a driven and adaptable individual who is currently pursuing my 7th semester of a B. Tech. in Biomedical Engineering.
I have a strong track record of academic success and have also taken it upon myself to expand my skillset 
by learning new software and techniques related to my field of study.

In addition to my coursework, I have actively sought out opportunities 
to gain practical experience and have gained valuable hands-on experience in areas such as 
MATLAB, LabVIEW, Python and more by learning them day by day. 

I am constantly looking for new ways to improve and expand my knowledge and skills 
in order to excel in my field and make a meaningful impact in the world of biomedical engineering.ðŸŽ¯

This is my new journey towards the Computer field in learning new ways to integrate it with healthcare.
I'm seeing new ways how computers will bring about changes in the environment of human health.
